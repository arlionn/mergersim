MERGERSIM PROGRAM REVISION LOG

$Rev: 183 $

Rev: 181

* Added marketshares option to simulate
* Made options in simulate independent of market

Rev: 178 

* Added demand subcommand with ssnip option
* Changed newowner() to newfirm()
* Tests that buyer & seller are specified unless newfirm() is used
* buyereff and sellereff can no longer be specified when newfirm option is used
* Changed costs() to newcosts() in simulate
* newcosts() and efficiencies() cannot be used at the same time
* Fixed error codes

Rev: 169

* mergersim_market tests that sigmas are between 0 and 1, warning otherwise
* mergersim_market tests that sigma2 < sigma1, warning otherwise 
* mergersim_market tests that alpha < 0
* mergersim_market warns if market or simulate is run on data not in estimate sample
* mergersim restructured to use Stata classes
* mergersim_market tests that costs > 0, throwing error if not
* mergersim_init tests that marketsize > totQ, throwing error if not
* with the name() option one can specify name of simulation. The prefix() option no longer exists

Rev: 153

* Made class Market an array

Rev: 149 

* Fixed display of variables generated
* Cleaning

Rev: 147 

* Added variable checking in mata code.
* Fixed a bug in mergersim_mre allowing the user to omit necessary options
* Renamed mergersim_predict to mergersim_equilibrium

Rev: 145 

* Tests that number of nests given by nests, alpha and sigma correspond.
* init, market and simulate can be invoked in any order.

Rev: 144

* Work on including mergersim_predict

Rev: 143

* Improved mergerim_predict output
* "Restored" output in init and market
* Removed costs and set as allowed subcommands
* Put common functionality in superclasses of Merger and Demand

Rev: 142 

* Added predict subcommand to calculate prices and quantities from costs and demand parameters.
* Added utility xtcreatepanel.ado to create random panel dataset

Rev: 141

* Fixed strange Stata behavior with classes when explicitly run in compile.ado 
* Variable labels loaded from .M class.
* Renamed collusion to conduct.

Rev: 140

* Separated demand specific functionality in mergersim_costs
* Renamed to mergersim_logit_elasticities

Rev: 139 

* Options alpha and sigmas now only allowed in mergersim_init.
* Separated all demand specific calculations in separate methods
* Created mergersim_logit.ado containing logit specific code as subcommands
* General cleaning

Rev: 138

* All options with variables that are numeric (firm, price, etc...) are now required to be numeric.
* Upper and lower bounds checked on buyereff, sellereff, collusion, newcollusion.
* Input of alpha < 0 and 0 <= sigmas <= 1 now required.
* Changed the number of iterations in non-convergence from maxit+1 to maxit.
* Moved nonnestedgroup variable into Mata.

Rev: 137

* Removed a level of indirection in variable naming
* Fixed maxit option.

Rev: 136 

* Refactored mergersim_init to separate out logit demand specific code.
* Finished transforuuumation of globals to Stata class by removing indirection through locals.

Rev: 135 

* Renamed M_logprice to M_lp to better conform to mergersim naming
* Only generate M_price, M_quantity and M_revenue if they do not exist

Rev: 134

* Fixed bug in mergersim_results.ado causing error with marketshares option.
* Updated help file
* Regression not shown if demand is calibrated
* Improved output appearance, with generated variables at bottom
* mergersim_results now uses variable labels as column headings
* Better display of collusion and newcollusion in mergersim_simulate
* Moved test of whether mergersim has been run to mergersim.ado
